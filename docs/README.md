# Documentation Directory

This directory contains ad-hoc documentation that doesn't need to be loaded in every Claude Code session.

## Usage
Reference files here using `@docs/filename.md` when needed, rather than importing them in CLAUDE.md.

## When to Use docs/
- Detailed API documentation
- Historical decisions
- Meeting notes
- Research findings
- Temporary documentation
- Examples and snippets

## When NOT to Use docs/
- Core project principles (use CLAUDE.md)
- Active conventions (use .claude/memory/)
- Current workflows (use .claude/memory/)

Keep files here focused and well-organized.
