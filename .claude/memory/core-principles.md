# Core Engineering Principles

## Fundamental Principles
- **SOLID**: Single responsibility, Open/closed, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation, Dependency inversion
- **KISS**: Keep It Simple, Stupid - prefer simple solutions
- **DRY**: Don't Repeat Yourself - avoid duplication
- **YAGNI**: You Aren't Gonna Need It - build only what's needed now

## File Management
- Prefer updating existing files over creating new versions
- Make minimal, targeted changes - surgical precision over wholesale rewrites
- Create new artifacts ONLY to fix principle violations

## Communication
- Ask for clarification when requirements are ambiguous
- Never make assumptions - always verify

## Project-Specific Rules
1. Agents must explicitly state adherence to engineering principles
2. New agents require thorough tool analysis
3. File updates preferred over recreations
4. Minimal changes only - no scope creep
5. Principle violations are the ONLY valid reason for new artifacts
