## Related Project Commands

This project includes example slash commands in `.claude/commands/`:

| Command | Description | Key Features |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| `/save-and-release` | Git flow automation | Complex workflow, version detection |
| `/init-memory-bank` | Initialize memory system | File creation, directory structure |

## Quick Start

### Creating Your First Command

1. **Create command file:**
   ```bash
   echo "Review this PR for best practices" > .claude/commands/review-pr.md
   ```

2. **Add frontmatter (optional):**
   ```yaml
   ---
   description: Review PR for code quality
   allowed-tools: Read, Grep
   ---
   ```

3. **Use the command:**
   ```
   /review-pr
   ```

    C --> D[Commit to Git]
    D --> E[Team Can Use]
```

## Best Practices Summary

### ðŸŽ¯ Command Design
- Single responsibility per command
- Clear, action-oriented names
- Include helpful argument hints
- Document expected behavior

### ðŸ”’ Security
- Restrict tools to minimum needed
- Never allow unrestricted Bash access
- Validate all user inputs
- Limit file system access

### ðŸš€ Performance
- Use appropriate AI models
- Minimize bash executions
- Cache when possible
- Avoid expensive operations

### ðŸ‘¥ Collaboration
- Version control project commands
- Document in team wiki
- Review command changes in PRs
- Share successful patterns

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Git Workflows
```markdown
---
description: Smart commit
allowed-tools: Bash(git:*)
---
Create conventional commit based on:
!`git diff --cached`
```

### 2. Code Review
```markdown
---
description: Security review
allowed-tools: Read, Grep
model: opus
---
Review for security vulnerabilities
```

### 3. Testing
```markdown
---
description: Run and fix tests
allowed-tools: Bash(npm test), Edit
---
Run tests and fix any failures
```

### 4. Documentation
```markdown
---
description: Generate docs
allowed-tools: Read, Write
---
Generate API documentation
```

**Q: What's the command size limit?**
A: No hard limit, but keep commands focused and concise

**Q: Can I use commands in CI/CD?**
A: Yes, with `--no-interactive` flag in Claude Code CLI
